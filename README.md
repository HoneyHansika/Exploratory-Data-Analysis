# I worked on a data analysis project focused on tab prices, I aimed to understand the factors that influence tab pricing.
# Key Steps of my projects are:
# Data Collection
•	" Using web scraping I collected data from Flipkart website, which included multiple features for different tab models."
Tools and Technologies
•	"I used Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and data cleaning, NumPy for numerical Analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization."
# 1.	Data Cleaning:
o	"First, I loaded the dataset into a Pandas Data Frame and performed simple exploration to understand the data distribution and identify any missing values, Duplicate rows and outliers."
o	"I handled missing values and outliers with statistical Methods. And I removed duplicate rows.
# 2.	Data Visualization:
o	"I created visualizations to understand the correlations between different features and the price. For example, I used a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix and histograms to understand the distribution of tab prices."
# 3.	Insights:
o	"From the analysis, I found that features like RAM, camera quality, and battery life had major impacts on tab prices. For instance, higher RAM and better camera quality were strongly correlated with higher prices."
# 4.	Conclusions:
o	"In conclusion, this project allowed me to apply various data analysis techniques to gain insights into tab pricing. It demonstrated my ability to handle data preprocessing and visualization.
